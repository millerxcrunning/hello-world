Hi, my name is Michael. I am a sophomore in the computer engineering program at Wright State University. I also coach high school cross country and track for Troy Christian High School, as well as work part-time as a server at a local restaurant. "Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins." -1 John 4:10
